    "* Can be thought of as attention to the extreme.\n",
    "    * Can be used as part of sequencing task and has replaced LSTMs generally.\n",
    "    * Has achieved SOTA in sequence-related tasks\n",
    "* Faster, scalable, more interpretable compared to RNN based models.\n",
    "    * Things are pretty much parallelized thus getting away the sequential computation of RNN based architecture."
